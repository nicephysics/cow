          You fall down with increasing velocity in the negative y-direction and land on your back in a dark place.
          “Owwww!!!” You cry out, just like a wolf.
          Then you think of your parents, and get up on your four feet.
          Where is this place? Did I just fall into a cow-trap?
          A million thoughts surface in your mind.
          You look around and realise the walls and the ground are hard and rocky.
          Recalling from a geography lesson in the farm – caves are enclosed spaces with hard, uneven grounds and walls – you think, “Is this a cave? No way! Aren’t caves difficult to get out of, especially for a cow?”
          Being young, you cry, sitting helplessly on the ground.

        <h5 class="padding-8">          
          After a few minutes, you stop crying and look up. I need to find a way out, you think. The ceiling was fairly low, but still too high for you to climb up to the trapdoor using all the rocks. You figure there is no way up there again.
          Disappointed, you walk around the cave... and discover a small hole in one of the walls!
          It was large enough for you to enter it, though. 
        </h5>
        <h5 class="padding-32">
          You crawl through… and an amazing sight greeted you!
