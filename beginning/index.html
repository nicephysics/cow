          The violent tornado swirled and turned, destroying everything that comes its way.
          “Mooooo!” The baby cow ran around, looking for his parents.
          He could hear the immense roar of the tornado coming towards them at a steady pace.
          There! His parents! He ran towards them, his short legs kicking against the strong, deadly wind.
          Just as he was about to reach the wrecked farm, something tugged him back, and he felt himself being pulled away from his parents, away from the place he called home.
          Four small legs got lifted off the ground, and he screamed as the tornado sucked him towards its centre...

          “Boom!” Lightning strikes the dark sky and you wake up with a start. Your vision is blurry and all you can hear is the wind howling at your ears.
          “Where am I? Where are my parents?” you think. Your stomach grumbles, and you wonder which stomach it was.
          Where was the grass you always had underneath your feet, on the ground that was always green?
          The ground felt nothing you had felt before – much less the colour – it was hard, shiny, and grey.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="padding-32">
          You lie down on your belly, the rain pouring hard on you. You don’t know what to do in this unfamiliar place. 
          Your eyelids feel heavy, and slowly, you fall into a deep, deep sleep...
        </h5>
        <h5 class="padding-32">
          You open your eyes. You feel energised. A drop of water falls down your nose.
          Suddenly, you remember the entire ordeal of the day. The sky was dark and you can see the moon.
          You realise that the once dense, heavy rain had diminished into a slight drizzle, and you stand up, determined to find your parents.
